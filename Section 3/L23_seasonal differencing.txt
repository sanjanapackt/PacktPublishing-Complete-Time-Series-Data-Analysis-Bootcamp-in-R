########## Seasonal differencing

##Seasonal difference of a time series is the series of changes 
##from one season to the next. 
##For monthly data, in which there are 12 periods in a season, 
##the seasonal difference of Y at period t is Yt - Yt-12.

##Seasonal differencing is a crude form of additive seasonal 
##adjustment: the "index" which is subtracted from each value of 
##the time series is simply the value that was observed in the 
##same season one year earlier
##This removes trend-- renders the time series stationary
