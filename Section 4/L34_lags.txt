###### Lags

library(forecast)
library(stats)

##When the time base is shifted by a given number of periods,
## a Lag of time series is created.
## Lags of a time series are often used as explanatory variables 
## to model the actual time series itself.

tsData = EuStockMarkets[, 1] # ts data

laggedTS =stats::lag(tsData, 3) # shifted 3 periods earlier
##lagged ts

##Use `-3` to shift by 3 periods forward.
