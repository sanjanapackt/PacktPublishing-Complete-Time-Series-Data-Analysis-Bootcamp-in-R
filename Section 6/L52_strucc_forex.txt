##Gaussian regression (with regime-specific variances). 
##The number of breakpoints are selected according to information criteria

#Exchange Rate Regression
#Interface to lm for fitting exchange rate regression models 
#(Frankel-Wei models).

##In many applications it is reasonable to assume that there 
##are m breakpoints
scus = gefp(flm, fit = NULL) #test for breakpoints
plot(scus, functional = supLM(0.1))
## add lines related to breaks to your plot
